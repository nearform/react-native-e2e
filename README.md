# Playground for Detox with a simple Android app
To run the app:
```
npm start
```
As of July 28 2022, Detox is just applied according to the [guide](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/android), I haven't run any tests yet. The app is a simple login form that shows the username you entered after logging in. It waits for 2 sec to simulate slow network so that Detox could show its benefits.
